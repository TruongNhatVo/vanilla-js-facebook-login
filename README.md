# A simple Sign In portal using the Facebook SDK for JavaScript

# Quickstart

- Clone the repository
- [Register as a Facebook developer and create a new Facebook app using the app dashboard.](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/register)
- Replace the `appId` value on line `25` of the file `app.js` with your app ID.
- Assuming you set your project's Authorized JavaScript origin and Authorized redirect URI to `http://localhost:8080`, then use a webserver like [Python's Simple HTTP Server](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html) to run your app. Like this: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
`
- Point your Browser to `http://localhost:8080` and now you can sign in using your Facebook Credentials
